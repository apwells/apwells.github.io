				      Music Composer / Music Producer

			      </a>
			      <p class="description">
				     This piece is currently running on TV. Directed by Michael Ferns and produced by Royle Productions in London. I wanted to create something subtle and beautiful that didn't lead emotionally too much. The narrator is telling his real story which is very moving, I didn't want to crowd that out with overly emotional music.

				     Composed by Dan Baboulene and directed by Jason Wingard. This upcoming feature is a hilarious comedy about Pete and Omar, two orphaned brothers who go in search of Omar's estranged father. We created a huge amount of music for this one. We flew to Prague to record the orchestra at Smecky Studios.

			      <p class="description">
				     This was a promotional piece to raise awareness of an issue that is severely under-represented and close to our directors heart. We wanted to shock the audience, so the re-make of "Good Mornin'" but with a dark twist felt perfect.

			      <p class="description">
				      I was asked by Pretzel Films to try my hand at creating a more classical and filmic score for this piece. I created what is quite a simple, but emotive piece that I believe fits the film and follows the mood and key moments. The sound design involved re-creating all poolside sounds. My soundtrack won Highly Commended at the 2017 EVCOM awards.

				      I've been working with Hobbie Stuart since we were both in school together back in Brighton. He's now a successful Youtube musician. We've written lots of songs together, made countless covers, and shot loads of videos together. Head over to his youtube channel; anything that isn't a vlog is probably a bit of my handiwork.

				      One of the many films that I have produced the music alongside excellent composer Dan Baboulene. This film was nominated for a Welsh Bafta! We recorded all the strings in my house, and the result is a huge orchestral sound that we're very proud of.

				      Gabriella is a very popular Youtuber known for her vlogs. Hobbie introduced us as Gabby wanted to start uploading some music to her channel. She's an excellent singer and lovely to work with, and its extremely fun making music that sounds anything like Disney.

				     This lovely piece produced by Jungle Creations for VT has had a 3.7 million views just 2 days after release at the time of writing. It's a lovely message and has been very well received. The work for me was just a simple case of mixing the dialogue for clarity (as there were varying levels of quality of the recordings sent in). I also added some sound design and extra strings to the ending of the library track to give a little more emotion at that point.

				      I was hired by Pretzel Films to add some subtle atmosphere and effects to make this wonderful film even more immersive and dreamy. I believe there were something like 14 films in total, so there were a few late nights involved.
